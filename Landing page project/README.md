# Landing Page Project



### 1st Project in the Udacity professional web development nanodegree
    . All the code that I wrote is in the app.js and I tried to explain every function in comments as much as I could.
    . I made slight changes in the index.html just to add more sections and change the section names.
    . made one more class in the style.css for the styling of the navbar elements


## Website features:
    . Dynamic navigation as an unordered list using empty 'ul' and then inserting into it.
    . It's clear which session is being viewed as I added a feature that highlights the name of the section the user is currently viewing.
    . Scrolling to the section on which the user has clicked on from the navigation menu.
    . stlyings added for active states.
    . 4 sections were added to the page.
    . All features are usable across modern desktop, tablet and phone browsers.
